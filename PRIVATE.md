# Notes

-   Managing bip32 seeds is probably better for my needs than managing
    individual private keys, but I may still do it if I decide to keep some of
    my existing paper wallets.
-   Michael Flaxman seems competent
-   Saleem Rashid seems like a very competent hardware hacker
-   I need to be careful when withdrawing partial funds from a BTC paper wallet
    due to the change address being set to a new address in most wallets by
    default
    ([/r/Bitcoin thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1c9xr7/psa_using_paper_wallets_understanding_change/)).
-   Trezor's developers seem more competent than Ledger's.
